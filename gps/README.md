A lot of this material will be based on GPyTorch's documentation but with more details (both mathematical and implementation)


* Basics: Introduce GPyTorch

* Exact inference: analytical solution

* Application: kaggle rainfall problem?

* Kernels: definition, algebra

* Learning hyperparameters

* Exact inference: BlackBox Matrix-Matrix Inference (BBMM)

* Exact inference: Lanczos Variance Estiamtes (LOVE)
